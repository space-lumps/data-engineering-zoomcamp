This repository will contain various Data Engineering Projects

### Project 1: Pipeline
End-to-end, Dockerized data ingestion pipeline that loads NYC Yellow Taxi trip data into PostgreSQL using Python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy. The project demonstrates schema-aware CSV ingestion, chunked loading for large datasets, CLI-driven configuration with Click, and full containerization with Docker and Docker Compose, including Postgres and pgAdmin. Designed to mirror a production-style analytics engineering workflow from raw data download through reproducible database loading and inspection.
